# recipe-website-part2b
This is a simple website that showcases three recipes using Express.js and EJS. The website includes a home page and three separate recipe pages. Each recipe displays the title, ingredients, servings, prep time, cook time, and instructions. The layout is consistent across all pages, with a shared header and footer.
